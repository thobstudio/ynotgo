### Introduction

ynotgo is an attempt to implement the Yjs crdt in golang.
the current focus on the project is to only see if yjs can be ported to go with as much compatibility as possible.

This project doesn't intend to have complete feature parity with yjs.
We don't plan on working on any of xml related types, but instead would be focusing more on other things.
